Honeybee
========

Honeybee is a free and open source plugin to connect Grasshopper3D to EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and OpenStudio for building energy and daylighting simulation.


Current release includes all the daylighting components and let the users to:

-   Prepare geometry: Users can create geometry for simulations by either starting with a mass and quickly turning it to a complete zone or creating the geometry surface by surface, enabling maximal freedom and control.

-  Generate RADIANCE materials: Users can generate a wide variety of Radiance materials by either specifying a material color or inputting individual numeric values for material properties.

-  Generate RADIANCE skies: Honeybee supports several sky types including a Climate-based sky, a Cumulative Climate-based sky, and several CIE Standard skies. Visualize the sky by using the “watch the sky” component.

-  Run several types of RADIANCE simulations: Honeybee enables users to run several types of accurate image-based analyses to produce images for luminance, Illuminance or Radiation. Honeybee supports all of the Radiance view types including Fish-eye, Parallel and Perspective, as well as both rendered and FalseColor images.  There are even components that enable users to calculate Daylight Factor and the Vertical Sky Component! Lastly, users can run image-based glare analyses using evalglare.

-  Run annual daylight analyses: Honeybee uses the Daysim engine to run annual daylight analysis. There is a full set of components for setting up this type of daylight study and another set for exploring the results. If you dare, you can even setup annual runs with dynamic blinds and advanced lighting controls.
